<h3>Evil dead rise</h3>
<p>"Evil Dead Rise" was honestly one of the best horror movies i've ever seen.
It introduced a whole new world of fear and anxiety that i've never felt being a horror movie fanatic.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Spirited away</h3>
<p>"Spirited Away" is one of my favorite movies because it takes me on a beautiful adventure into a mesmerizing spirit world.
I am drawn to Chihiro's transformation from a timid girl to a courageous protagonist, facing challenges and discovering her true identity.
The captivating visuals and rich storytelling, infused with themes friendship and cultural heritage, deeply resonate with me.
It's a film that transports me to a realm of enchantment and leaves me feeling inspired and connected to its magical universe.</p>

<h3>The taking of Deborah Logan</h3>
<p>Fear takes a whole new meaning as we watch an elderly woman slowly descend into madnes and what looks like demonic possession.
"The taking of Deborah Logan" was a true masterpiece in my humble opinion.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Artifice girl</h3>
<p>"Artifice Girl" follows an AI programmer who uses his knowledge of coding and his disdain for pedophiles in order to create an AI program that can bait multiple pedophiles at once.
The AI eventually evolves past its original programming and develops what humans would consider "emotions".
It is a beautiful movie that shows the possibilities of AI and its uses, while also grasping the full scope of where AI could end up as humanity continues to learn about and build upon it.</p>
